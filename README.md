# Generator for Yii and Yii2 apps

I know it's quite strange to write generator for php projects using node.js + Yeoman, but that's that.

## Getting started

- Make sure you have [yo](https://github.com/yeoman/yo) installed:
    `npm install -g yo`
- Install the generator: `npm install -g generator-yii`
- Run: `yo yii`
- To create yii2 project run: `yo yii --yii2`
